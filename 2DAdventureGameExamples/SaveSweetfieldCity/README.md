### Overview
This is an Interaction Design Course project about how the existence of Sacrifice Zones affect its underserved communities because of the extraction of resources. This project aims to explore interaction tables, navigating between screens with an avatar and collision mapping.

This game is a series of rooms, some structured as maps, dedicated to exploring how social inequities, particularly environmental racism, impacts underserved communities around the United States if not the world. The game’s progression will be based on the 8 tiers defining Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, each serving as one level, for a total of 8 levels.

### Narrative
The relentless search for hidden treasures around the world has destroyed the land as we know it. Sweetfield City is now seen as a dangerous, unsafe, and grim place. Once glorious, its sweetfields are now desolate, its air toxic, and its people divided — all thanks to the unrelenting men of its neighboring city of Goldfolk. 

As a bright and noble young woman, Felicity Walker is Sweetfield’s only hope. Felicity (player) hopes to find the courage to start a revolutionary organization called the Freedom Fighters so that they may bring back the justice that was taken away from them. Will you help Felicity stop her hometown from becoming a Sacrifice Zone?

### Technical Details
Created in p5.js, the user interaction relies on navigation keys such as the left, right, up, and down arrow keys for choosing different options in certain screens; the enter key (or mouse input) in order to advance to the next screen; and other keys throughout the different levels. The code is based on [INSERT NUMBER] states: some states (screens) will prompt the player to make decisions that will determine the outcome of the story. The main abstraction strategy I used are array of arrays and defining functions that display each screen in an organized way. The following code structures are taken from Repositories provided in class: (1) interaction tables, (2) subclasses (PNG Rooms), (3) collision maps. 

The assets folder contains any image files for icons, backgrounds, avatars, NPCs, font, and other elements used in the project. The font I used is Katrinus, which is my own font in TTF.

The development folder includes project files with the code structure, initial brainstorming sketches, and the state machine I created for easier abstraction of the project.  

The data folder contains all CSV files for the interaction tables embedded in the sketch.js code.

Prototype (Adobe XD)
The AdobeXD file consists of the 28 screens as a mockup of the code and storyline, which is in the link below:
