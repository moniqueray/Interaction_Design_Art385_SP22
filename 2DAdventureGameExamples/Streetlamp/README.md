### About
Streetlamp is a game which satirizes Orientalist tendencies in physical and fictional environments. By exploring anti-Asian racism within visual and storytelling mediums that bleeds into the real world, it calls attention to the fetishization and sexualization Asian women suffer, in addition to criticizing tired racist tropes and stereotypes which are commonplace in Western media. 

### Overview
This game addresses multiple tired tropes that the Asian community faces in its media representation: 
* obsession with revenge
* obsession with filial piety
* a vague quest for â€œmythical power"
* hypersexualized and one-dimensional female characters

... as well as real-life issues that the Asian community faces:
* sexual harassment
* sexual exploitation
* model minority myth and desire for assimilation

Through this satirical lens, at times comical and at times dark, these objects of interest are explored in this work.

Within the game itself, the player is Ren, a young woman whose parents have been murdered, and it is up to her to avenge their honor while combating other dark forces within the city of New Chinatown.
